### Description
This is a website that generates a random quote each time a button is clicked, done as code practice. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The user stories and test suite were created by Free Code Camp.

### User Stories
* User Story #1: I can see a wrapper element with a corresponding id="quote-box".
* User Story #2: Within #quote-box, I can see an element with a corresponding id="text".
* User Story #3: Within #quote-box, I can see an element with a corresponding id="author".
* User Story #4: Within #quote-box, I can see a clickable element with a corresponding id="new-quote".
* User Story #5: Within #quote-box, I can see a clickable a element with a corresponding id="tweet-quote".
* User Story #6: On first load, my quote machine displays a random quote in the element with id="text".
* User Story #7: On first load, my quote machine displays the random quote's author in the element with id="author".
* User Story #8: When the #new-quote button is clicked, my quote machine should fetch a new quote and display it in the #text element.
* User Story #9: My quote machine should fetch the new quote's author when the #new-quote button is clicked and display it in the #author element.
* User Story #10: I can tweet the current quote by clicking on the #tweet-quotea element. This a element should include the "twitter.com/intent/tweet" path in its href attribute to tweet the current quote.
* User Story #11: The #quote-box wrapper element should be horizontally centered. Please run tests with browser's zoom level at 100% and page maximized.
